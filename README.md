EE 556 Final Project

In this project, we study how to construct an RL Mario controller agent, which can learn from the game environment. We plan to apply and adjust some well-known reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to train an automatic agent to play the 1985 Nintendo game Super Mario Bros. The agent may learn several control policies from raw pixel data by using deep reinforcement learning. By the end of the project, we anticipate that the model should perform equivalently to or top human performance in a given stage.
We aim to study how to adapt and improve the Atari Deep Q Network to train a Mario controller agent, which can learn from the game raw pixel data and in-game score.
